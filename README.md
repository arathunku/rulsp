# TODO

- apply
- better error message (file, line number, location in line)
- modules
- use alternative lexer? (nom?, something else?)
- booleans
- strings
- more comp funcs (>, <, <=, >=, ...?)
- floats
- try/catch or maybe more rusty way to handle errors?
- intercop with Rust(?!)
- tree analyzer - verify types before execution as much as possible
